    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My name is CÃ©lio Vieira, I made this application simple in order to present it to my institution, for the purpose of obtaining a grade in a proposed learning check. The project consists of an application made in PHP that allows user registration, as well as managing the activities of these users. In short, it is a beta, so there may be some bugs.</p>
